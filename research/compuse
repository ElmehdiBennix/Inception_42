    # Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. Here's a comprehensive list of Docker Compose commands you might find useful:

- Docker Compose Commands :
---------------------------

 * docker-compose up: Starts and runs the entire app. it builds the image if it dosent exist or   
                      updates it if changes are made to it
 * docker-compose down: Stops and removes containers, networks, optionally : volumes, and images
                        created by up.
                    --rmi all or "image name" / to remove all images built my compose 
                    --volumes or -v / removes the volumes of the container

 * docker-compose push: Pushes images for services to a Docker registry.
 * docker-compose logs: Shows logs from services.

 * docker-compose kill: Forces running containers to stop.
 * docker-compose config: Validates and displays the Compose file.
 * <!-- docker-compose version: Shows the Docker Compose version information. -->
 * <!-- docker-compose convert: Converts the Compose file to another format (e.g., Docker Swarm). -->
 * docker-compose exec: Executes a command in a running container.
 * docker-compose run: Runs a one-time command against a service.
