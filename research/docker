--> Docker :
    docker makes dev software mush easy to manage it solves it runs on my machine and that is usualy caused because of
diffrant env and versions or dependencys the program needs to work maybe my code needs an
old version of python to work and i got the latest one that might introduce some problems 
of my program thats where docker comes in (lets just say it shipes ur machine every where so it could run no matter what)
    the way it solves that problem by using whats called containers to run application in isolated environment in ur computer

-> lets give an example to explain the above :
    lets say we have a specific application that require a specific version of python which has a future i needed to use
and some environment and files setup for it to work also i need to share it to other computer and need it to work
usualy i need to go and setup each computer dev env alone for it to work and that will take alot of time to do and
might introduce problems if the app has too mush dependencys to manage 

# thats where docker comes and solves that problem by making containers that has every things the application needs to run
correctly and it run in isolation away from any other proceess the only thing u need on ur computer is docker to manage
them
