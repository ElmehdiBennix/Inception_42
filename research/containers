--> containers vs VMs :
    - each vm u run has a full os with its kernel running on top of ur os system depending on the hypervisor type
    - containers on the other hand shares the host operationg system kernel meaning they are fast and less bloated which leads in better performace
        they are quicker to start up and consume less resorcess containers do include a slim down version of a os but still use the host machine kernel
        under the hood 
-----> both can solve the same problem its just a quastion of the use case.




 ??? containers can be pulled to production server so that u dont need to configure the server
