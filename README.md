# Docker System Administration Project

This project focuses on expanding system administration knowledge through the practical use of Docker. The goal is to virtualize various Docker images by creating and managing them within a dedicated personal virtual machine.

## Project Objectives:
- Explore and implement Docker virtualization for system administration tasks.
- Create Docker images for specific purposes within a personal virtual environment.
- Gain hands-on experience with containerization, deployment, and orchestration using Docker.
- Document the process, challenges, and solutions encountered during the Dockerization of system administration tasks.

## Key Features:
- Docker image creation for system administration tasks.
- Documentation detailing the steps involved in virtualization.
- Personal virtual machine setup for running Docker containers.
- Practical examples of Dockerizing common system administration scenarios.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the provided documentation to set up your personal virtual machine.
3. Explore the Docker images created for various system administration tasks.
4. Experiment with containerization, deployment, and orchestration using Docker.

Happy Dockerizing!
